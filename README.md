**Description**

Battleships is a command line version of the popular real-world game with the same name. It is written entirely in Ruby.

**Model**

The objects in our code are: Ship, Grid, Interface, Display, Enemy

Ship: The ship is a class that creates five different types of ships and assigns them lengths and names.

Grid: This is the central object with which every other object interacts. It displays coordinates and populates them with ships. It also registers hits and misses.

Game: This stores the logic of the game. It takes inputs from the user, displays the grid, and displays changes occurring to the grid. Prints game messages e.g. "You've Hit." "You've Missed." "Please Enter Your Name."

Enemy: This class is the AI of the game. It'll consist of the moves that the computer can make against the human player.


WE STOPPED SKETCHING AND JUST STARTED CODING. SORRY!
